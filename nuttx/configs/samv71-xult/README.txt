Serial Console
==============

The SAMV71-XULT has no on-board RS-232 drivers so it will be necessary to
use either the VCOM or an external RS-232 driver.  Here are some options.

  - Arduino Serial Shield:  One option is to use an Arduino-compatible
    serial shield.  This will use the RXD and TXD signals available at pins
    0 an 1, respectively, of the Arduino "Digital Low" connector.  On the
    SAMV71-XULT board, this corresponds to UART3:

    ------ ------ ------- ------- --------
    Pin on SAMV71 Arduino Arduino SAMV71
    J503   PIO    Name    Pin     Function
    ------ ------ ------- ------- --------
      1    PD28   RX0     0       URXD3
      2    PD30   TX0     1       UTXD3
    ------ ------ ------- ------- --------

  - SAMV7-XULT EXTn connectors.  USART pins are also available the EXTn
    connectors.  The following are labelled in the User Guide for USART
    functionality:

    ---- -------- ------ --------
    EXT1 EXTI1    SAMV71 SAMV71
    Pin  Name     PIO    Function
    ---- -------- ------ --------
    13   USART_RX PB00   RXD0
    14   USART_TX PB01   TXD0

    ---- -------- ------ --------
    EXT2 EXTI2    SAMV71 SAMV71
    Pin  Name     PIO    Function
    ---- -------- ------ --------
    13   USART_RX PA21   RXD1
    14   USART_TX PB04   TXD1

  - VCOM.  The Virtual Com Port gateway is available on USART1:

    ------ --------
    SAMV71 SAMV71
    PIO    Function
    ------ --------
    PB04   TXD1
    PA21   RXD1
    ------ --------

Any of these options can be selected as the serial console by:

  1. Enabling the UART/USART peripheral in the
     "System Type -> Peripheral Selection" menu, then
  2. Configuring the peripheral in the "Drivers -> Serial Configuration"
     menu.

LEDs and Buttons
================

LEDs
----
There are two yellow LED available on the SAM V71 Xplained Ultra board that
can be turned on and off.  The LEDs can be activated by driving the
connected I/O line to GND.

  ------ ----------- ---------------------
  SAMV71 Function    Shared functionality

  ------ ----------- ---------------------
  PA23   Yellow LED0 EDBG GPIO
  PC09   Yellow LED1 LCD, and Shield
  ------ ----------- ---------------------

These LEDs are not used by the board port unless CONFIG_ARCH_LEDS is
defined.  In that case, the usage by the board port is defined in
include/board.h and src/sam_autoleds.c. The LEDs are used to encode
OS-related events as follows:

  -------------------  -----------------------  -------- --------
  SYMBOL                Meaning                     LED state
                                                  LED0     LED1
  -------------------  -----------------------  -------- --------
  LED_STARTED          NuttX has been started     OFF      OFF
  LED_HEAPALLOCATE     Heap has been allocated    OFF      OFF
  LED_IRQSENABLED      Interrupts enabled         OFF      OFF
  LED_STACKCREATED     Idle stack created         ON       OFF
  LED_INIRQ            In an interrupt              No change
  LED_SIGNAL           In a signal handler          No change
  LED_ASSERTION        An assertion failed          No change
  LED_PANIC            The system has crashed     N/C      Blinking
  LED_IDLE             MCU is is sleep mode         Not used
  -------------------  -----------------------  -------- --------

Thus if LED0 is statically on, NuttX has successfully booted and is,
apparently, running normally.  If LED1 is flashing at approximately
2Hz, then a fatal error has been detected and the system has halted.

NOTE: That LED0 is not used after completion of booting and may
be used by other board-specific logic.

Buttons
-------
SAM V71 Xplained Ultra contains three mechanical buttons. One button is the
RESET button connected to the SAM V71 reset line and the others are generic
user configurable buttons. When a button is pressed it will drive the I/O
line to GND.

  ------ ----------- ---------------------

NOTES:

  - There are no pull-up resistors connected to the generic user buttons so
    it is necessary to enable the internal pull-up in the SAM V71 to use the
    button.
  - PB12 is set up as a system flash ERASE pin when the firmware boots. To
    use the SW1, PB12 has to be configured as a normal regular I/O pin in
    the MATRIX module. For more information see the SAM V71 datasheet.

AT24MAC402 Serial EEPROM
========================

The SAM V71 Xplained Ultra features one external AT24MAC402 serial EEPROM
with a EIA-48 MAC address connected to the SAM V71 through I2C. This device
contains a MAC address for use with the Ethernet interface.

  ------ -------- -------- ------------------------------------------

I2C address:

  The 7-bit address of the AT24 part is is 0b1011AAA where AAA is the state
  of the A0, A1, and A3 pins on the part.  On the SAMV71-XULT board, these
  are all pulled high so the full, 7-bit address is 0x5f.

Debugging
=========

The on-board EDBG appears to work only with Atmel Studio.  You can however,
simply connect a SAM-ICE or J-Link to the JTAG/SWD connector on the board
and that works great.  The only tricky thing is getting the correct
orientation of the JTAG connection.

I have been using Atmel Studio to write code to flash then I use the Segger
J-Link GDB server to debug.  I have been using the 'Device Programming' I
available under the Atmel Studio 'Tool' menu.  I have to disconnect the
SAM-ICE while programming with the EDBG.  I am sure that you could come up
with a GDB server-only solution if you wanted.

I run GDB like this from the directory containing the NuttX ELF file:

  arm-none-eabi-gdb
  (gdb) target remote localhost:2331
  (gdb) mon reset
  (gdb) file nuttx
  (gdb) ... start debugging ...

Configurations
==============

Information Common to All Configurations
----------------------------------------
Each SAMV71-XULT configuration is maintained in a sub-directory and
can be selected as follow:

  cd tools
  ./configure.sh samv71-xult/<subdir>
  cd -
  . ./setenv.sh

Before sourcing the setenv.sh file above, you should examine it and perform
edits as necessary so that TOOLCHAIN_BIN is the correct path to the directory
than holds your toolchain binaries.

And then build NuttX by simply typing the following.  At the conclusion of
the make, the nuttx binary will reside in an ELF file called, simply, nuttx.

  make oldconfig
  make

The <subdir> that is provided above as an argument to the tools/configure.sh
must be is one of the following.

NOTES:

  1. These configurations use the mconf-based configuration tool.  To
    change any of these configurations using that tool, you should:

    a. Build and install the kconfig-mconf tool.  See nuttx/README.txt
       and misc/tools/

    b. Execute 'make menuconfig' in nuttx/ in order to start the
       reconfiguration process.

  2. Unless stated otherwise, all configurations generate console
     output on USART3 (i.e., for the Arduino serial shield).

  3. All of these configurations are set up to build under Windows using the
     "GNU Tools for ARM Embedded Processors" that is maintained by ARM
     (unless stated otherwise in the description of the configuration).

       https://launchpad.net/gcc-arm-embedded

     As of this writing (2015-03-11), full support is difficult to find
     for the Cortex-M&, but is supported by at least this realeasse of
     the ARM GNU tools:

       https://launchpadlibrarian.net/192228215/release.txt

     That toolchain selection can easily be reconfigured using
     'make menuconfig'.  Here are the relevant current settings:

     Build Setup:
       CONFIG_HOST_WINDOWS=y               : Window environment
       CONFIG_WINDOWS_CYGWIN=y             : Cywin under Windows

     System Type -> Toolchain:
       CONFIG_ARMV7M_TOOLCHAIN_GNU_EABIW=y : GNU ARM EABI toolchain

Configuration sub-directories
-----------------------------

  nsh:

    Configures the NuttShell (nsh) located at examples/nsh.
    NOTES:

    1. The serial console is configured by default for use with and Arduino
       serial shield (UART3).  You will need to reconfigure if you will
       to use a different U[S]ART.

    2. Default stack sizes are large and should really be tuned to reduce
       the RAM footprint:

         CONFIG_ARCH_INTERRUPTSTACK=2048
         CONFIG_IDLETHREAD_STACKSIZE=1024
         CONFIG_USERMAIN_STACKSIZE=2048
         CONFIG_PTHREAD_STACK_DEFAULT=2048
         ... and others ...

    3. NSH built-in applications are supported.

       Binary Formats:
         CONFIG_BUILTIN=y           : Enable support for built-in programs

       Application Configuration:
         CONFIG_NSH_BUILTIN_APPS=y  : Enable starting apps from NSH command line

    3. The button test at apps/examples/buttons is included in the
       configuration.  This configuration illustrates (1) use of the buttons
       on the evaluation board, and (2) the use of PIO interrupts.  Example
       usage:

       NuttShell (NSH) NuttX-7.8
       nsh> help
       help usage:  help [-v] [<cmd>]
       ...
       Builtin Apps:
         buttons
       nsh> buttons 3
       maxbuttons: 3
       Attached handler at 4078f7 to button 0 [SW0], oldhandler:0
       Attached handler at 4078e9 to button 1 [SW1], oldhandler:0
       IRQ:125 Button 1:SW1 SET:00:
         SW1 released
       IRQ:125 Button 1:SW1 SET:02:
         SW1 depressed
       IRQ:125 Button 1:SW1 SET:00:
         SW1 released
       IRQ:90 Button 0:SW0 SET:01:
         SW0 depressed
       IRQ:90 Button 0:SW0 SET:00:
         SW0 released
       IRQ:125 Button 1:SW1 SET:02:
         SW1 depressed
       nsh>

    4. TWI/I2C

       TWIHS0 is enabled in this configuration.  The SAM V71 Xplained Ultra
       supports two devices on the one on-board I2C device on the TWIHS0 bus:
       (1) The AT24MAC402 serial EEPROM described above and (2) the Wolfson
       WM8904 audio CODEC.  This device contains a MAC address for use with
       the Ethernet interface.

       In this configuration, the I2C tool at apps/system/i2ctool is
       enabled.  This tools supports interactive access to I2C devices on
       the enabled TWIHS bus.  Relevant configuration settings:

         CONFIG_SAMV7_TWIHS0=y
         CONFIG_SAMV7_TWIHS0_FREQUENCY=100000

         CONFIG_I2C=y
         CONFIG_I2C_TRANSFER=y

         CONFIG_SYSTEM_I2CTOOL=y
         CONFIG_I2CTOOL_MINBUS=0
         CONFIG_I2CTOOL_MAXBUS=0
         CONFIG_I2CTOOL_MINADDR=0x03
         CONFIG_I2CTOOL_MAXADDR=0x77
         CONFIG_I2CTOOL_MAXREGADDR=0xff
         CONFIG_I2CTOOL_DEFFREQ=400000

       Example usage:

         nsh> i2c
         Usage: i2c <cmd> [arguments]
         Where <cmd> is one of:

           Show help     : ?
           List busses   : bus
           List devices  : dev [OPTIONS] <first> <last>
           Read register : get [OPTIONS] [<repititions>]
           Show help     : help
           Write register: set [OPTIONS] <value> [<repititions>]
           Verify access : verf [OPTIONS] [<value>] [<repititions>]

         Where common "sticky" OPTIONS include:
           [-a addr] is the I2C device address (hex).  Default: 03 Current: 03
           [-b bus] is the I2C bus number (decimal).  Default: 0 Current: 0
           [-r regaddr] is the I2C device register address (hex).  Default: 00 Current: 00
           [-w width] is the data width (8 or 16 decimal).  Default: 8 Current: 8
           [-s|n], send/don't send start between command and data.  Default: -n Current: -n
           [-i|j], Auto increment|don't increment regaddr on repititions.  Default: NO Current: NO
           [-f freq] I2C frequency.  Default: 400000 Current: 400000

         NOTES:
         o An environment variable like $PATH may be used for any argument.
         o Arguments are "sticky".  For example, once the I2C address is
           specified, that address will be re-used until it is changed.

         WARNING:
         o The I2C dev command may have bad side effects on your I2C devices.
           Use only at your own risk.
         nsh> i2c bus

         nsh>

       Where 0x1a us the address of the WM8904 Audio CODEC and 0x5f is the
       address of the AT24 EEPROM (I am not sure what the others are as
       this writing).

       CAREFUL!!! You can trash your MAC address using the I2C tool!

    5. Performance-related Configuration settings:
