 * Name: boardctl
 *
 * Description:
 *   In a small embedded system, there will typically be a much greater
 *   interaction between application and low-level board features.  The
 *   canonically correct to implement such interactions is by implementing a
 *   character driver and performing the interactions via low level ioctl
 *   calls.  This, however, may not be practical in many cases and will lead
 *   to "correct" but awkward implementations.
 *
 *   boardctl() is non-standard OS interface to alleviate the problem.  It
 *   basically circumvents the normal device driver ioctl interlace and allows
 *   the application to perform direction IOCTL-like calls to the board-specific
 *   logic.  In it is especially useful for setting up board operational and
 *   test configurations.
 *
 * Input Parameters:
 *   cmd - Identifies the board command to be executed
 *   arg - The argument that accompanies the command.  The nature of the
 *         argument is determined by the specific command.
 *
 * Returned Value:
 *   On success zero (OK) is returned; -1 (ERROR) is returned on failure
 *   with the errno variable to to indicate the nature of the failure.
 *
